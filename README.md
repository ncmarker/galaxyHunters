# Galaxy Hunters

**Galaxy Hunters** is a 2-player cooperative bullet hell game where you fight off waves of alien robots, take down massive bosses, and try to save the world. Built in Unity, this project was developed over the course of a semester and includes unique character abilities, weapon upgrades, and interactive power-ups designed to create a fun and strategic multiplayer experience.
